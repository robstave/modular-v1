# üîß Modular Synth System Overview (Lunetta-Inspired)

This document describes a custom-built modular synth system inspired by **Stanley Lunetta‚Äôs CMOS-based designs**, along with elements from **CGS** (Cat Girl Synth) and microcontroller logic. The system uses banana jacks and 5V logic-level signals, mixing analog and digital modules across 11 vertical panels.

## üîå Panel 1: Power and Ground Distribution
- Provides 5V power and a ground reference for the whole system.
- Essential when patching in external modules (e.g., Baby 8).
- Red banana jack = +5V, black = GND.

> üí° **Tip**: Always connect ground before any signal to avoid floating logic levels.

---

## üéõÔ∏è Panel 2: Hex Oscillators ([40106](https://www.ti.com/product/CD40106B))
- Each inverter is configured as a square wave oscillator.
- Toggle switches select high or low frequency range.
- Black jack = gate input.
- Useful for tones or modulation of logic gates.

---

## üîä Panel 3: Voltage-Controlled Oscillators (VCOs)
- Two working VCOs with:
  - Top knob: frequency
  - Bottom knob: CV amount
  - Blue jack: CV input
  - Square wave output on right
- Green jack outputs are likely a mix.
- One VCO section is non-functional.

> ‚öôÔ∏è **CV input works best with**: LFOs or output from R-2R for stepped tones.

---

## üîó Panel 4: NAND & XOR Logic Gates
- 2 NANDs and 2 XORs using CMOS logic chips.
- Black jacks = inputs, Red = outputs.
- Great for creating gate patterns or rhythmic pulses.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Requires full logic HIGH (5V)** to activate gates properly.

---

## üåä Panel 5: Analog LFOs (ATTINY85-Based)
- Microcontroller-driven scene selection.
- Red button selects waveform combinations.
- Outputs:
  - Green: analog (sine, ramp, triangle)
  - Red: logic-level square
  - Blue: chaotic mix of both LFOs

> üéØ Excellent for clocking VCOs, driving CV inputs, or modulating LPGs.

---

## üîò Panel 6: NAND/NOR + Manual One-Shots
- Three sets of logic gates:
  - IN1 + IN2 (black)
  - OUT1 = NAND, OUT2 = NOR (red)
- Bottom buttons = momentary logic HIGH triggers.

> ‚úã **Use case**: Interactive triggering for rhythm generation or clock seeding.

---

## üé≤ Panel 7: Probability Gate (ATTINY85-Based)
- Clock-driven random gate generator.
- Inputs:
  - Black = Clock
- Outputs:
  - Red = Probabilistic gates
- Knobs:
  - Top: probability
  - Bottom: gate width

> ü•Å **Ideal for**: Triggering drum modules or adding randomness to sequences.

---

## üö™ Panel 8: LPGs + Mixers + Output Adapter
- 4x **Low-Pass Gates** using vactrols:
  - Blue = audio in
  - Yellow = gate trigger
  - Green = output
  - Switch = darker/faster cap choice
- 2x passive mixers with grounding buttons.
- Passive banana to ¬º" output.

> üßº Best for subtle, organic fading with LFOs ‚Äî not snappy percussive envelopes.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Panel 9: Clock Dividers
- Two independent divider banks.
- Black input, red divided outputs.
- Visual feedback via **bright blue LEDs**.

> üîÅ Use to derive slower patterns or sub-rhythms from fast clocks.

---

## üßÆ Panel 10: R-2R Ladder DAC + Mixer + Output
- R-2R resistor ladder creates stepped voltages.
- Input digital signals via black jacks.
- Output stepped analog voltages via red jacks.
- Patch red to VCO CV for sequencer-style output.
- Bottom section includes passive mixer and ¬º" output.

> üî¢ Generates sequences when clocked digital inputs are sent to black jacks.

---

## üéöÔ∏è Panel 11: Audio Mixer
- Summing mixer for combining audio sources.
- Final output stage.
- Likely passive.

> üéß Combine all your oscillators or processed signals here before external amplification or recording.
